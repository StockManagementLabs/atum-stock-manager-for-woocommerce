##Description

**âœ¨ NEW IMPROVED ATUM v1.9**

**ðŸ’» NEW [ATUM REST API](https://stockmanagementlabs.github.io/atum-rest-api-docs/)**

####AVAILABLE PREMIUM ADD-ONS

ðŸš€ [Product Levels - Bill Of Materials Management](https://stockmanagementlabs.com/addons/atum-product-levels/)

A bill of materials (also known as a BOM or bill of material) is a broad list of items, product parts, raw materials, assemblies, and other components mandatory to create a product. Even the guidance or direction needed for preparation is understood to be part of BOM. We interpret the bill of materials as the recipe for creating a final product. To start a manufacturing process, every entrepreneur no matter what trade has to start by establishing a bill of materials (BOM).

The current version of Product Levels introduces the first two levels of BOM. ATUM inventory management for WooCommerce lets you set companyâ€™s Raw Materials and Product Parts. Retailers, distributors, wholesalers, standard manufacturers, or any other businesses that need to take complete control over their growth will find this premium add-on irreplaceable. Our experienced team of developers and designers bring new features on monthly basis. Many other components of the manufacturing process are still to come. Read the full list of currently included functions below.

ðŸš€ [Multi-Inventory for WooCommerce](https://stockmanagementlabs.com/addons/atum-multi-inventory/)

WooCommerce, as the most popular WordPress e-commerce solution, did not include an option for business selling from different warehouses or using several suppliers. Up until now, shop owners have had a choice to either find a 3rd party solution or to have one built specifically for their site. Neither solution is ideal unless the shop has a significant budget to cover the cost.

ATUMâ€™s Multi-Inventory premium add-on is trying to remove the above issues and brings advanced features for a fracture of the cost charged by 3rd party service. Now you, as a shop owner have the option to add as many inventory records per product as your business needs. What is even better, the system is trying to push the editing boundaries far beyond the usual standard. Scroll below to find out about all existing and soon to come features or even try the demo FREE of charge.

ðŸš€ [ATUM Export Pro Premium Add-on](https://stockmanagementlabs.com/addons/atum-export-pro/)

Generate manual or automated exports of almost any data in your stores. We believe the most advanced tool of its kind with XML, CSV, and JSON exports to be available at launch. If it was not enough, we are adding an import tool as a bonus.

Exports of data are done automatically instead of copying and pasting manually. The ability to export data has an enormous economic advantage. Such data can then be used in further business controlling systems or in other business software.

ðŸš€ [ATUM Action Logs Premium Add-on](https://stockmanagementlabs.com/addons/atum-action-logs/)

Keeping track of any changes happening in your shop has never been easier. The Action Logs add-on supports all ATUM premium add-ons and all WooCommerce actions.

ATUM Action Logs aims to bring complete control into the WooCommerce inventory management. Every action or everyday task users take within the process needs to be recorded. These recordings we call action logs. Lots of outsides and inside factors are involved in fulfilling the inventory management process.

We equipped the ATUM Action Logs with a complete set of recording tools to avoid any capital loss.
Keeping track of any changes happening in your shop has never been easier. The Action Logs add-on supports all ATUM premium add-ons and all WooCommerce actions.

##Frequently Asked Questions

#####What are the minimum ATUM requirements?

ATUM requires PHP version 5.6 or greater (recommended 7.1.3 or greater), WordPress 4.7 or greater (recommended 5.0 or greater) and WooCommerce 2.7.0 or greater (recommended 3.6 or greater), but our recommended environment is the same as WooCommerce:
[https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/server-requirements/).

**For ATUM to work you need to activate the Enable Stock Management option in WooCommerce settings (WooCommerce-Settings-Products-Inventory-Manage Stock).

Also, we recommend of having WooCommerce up-to-date as we test and adapt ATUM for the latest version.

#####Is ATUM plugin FREE?

ATUM inventory management plugin is completely free and will stay as such. It was designed to suit most users that need essential inventory control of their business. However, for users that wish to take their inventory management further have the opportunity of using one of our [Premium Add-ons](https://stockmanagementlabs.com/addons/ "Our Premium Add-Ons").

#####How do I preview and monitor products in the Stock Central screen?

In Stock Central screen, you can sort your products into two lists, the 'controlled' and 'uncontrolled' list. Products you would like to monitor, control or edit you will see in the default controlled list that shows 'immediately' after you open the Stock Central screen. Products you do not wish to monitor you can find in the 'uncontrolled' list. Move products from one list to another is quick and straightforward and can be done directly on the Stock Central screen.

#####Can I quickly change the stock amount for individual products?

Yes, click the stock amount of the relevant product under the "Current Stock" column. ATUM opens a little pop-up, where you can apply your change. Now you can do many changes at the same time and hit the save button that appears on the top left.

#####I have a problem, who do I contact and how?

Please, in case of a technical issue open an official [support ticket](https://stockmanagementlabs.ticksy.com/) or if it is a simple request, leave a post in the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/atum-stock-manager-for-woocommerce).

#####Does Stock Central support product variations?

Product variations are fully supported and editable from Stock Central. ATUM handles variable products with ease and uses an expandable feature to make things clear and straightforward.

#####I have updated the ATUM plugin to the last version, and I can't see the new functionality

If you are using some cache system, try to purge the cache or ask your hosting provider to do it.
Also, try to reload the ATUM pages with CTRL + F5 (Windows) or CMD + R (MacOs) to clear your browser cache.

#####The plugin won't work < PHP 5.6

We are very sorry, but the current version of the plugin needs PHP 5.6+. Our team has tested it on PHP7 that is recommended by WordPress. Please, see the link here https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/

We do not plan any support for older PHP and version 5.6 is the minimum.
