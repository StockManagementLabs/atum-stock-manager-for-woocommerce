== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the minimum ATUM requirements? =

ATUM requires PHP version 5.6 or greater (recommended 7.1.3 or greater), WordPress 5.0 or greater and WooCommerce 2.7.0 or greater (recommended 3.6 or greater), but our recommended environment is the same as WooCommerce:
[https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/server-requirements/).

**For ATUM to work you need to activate the Enable Stock Management option in WooCommerce settings (WooCommerce-Settings-Products-Inventory-Manage Stock).

Also, we recommend of having WooCommerce up-to-date as we test and adapt ATUM for the latest version.

= Is ATUM plugin FREE? =

ATUM inventory management plugin is completely free and will stay as such. It was designed to suit most users that need essential inventory control of their business. However, for users that wish to take their inventory management further have the opportunity of using one of our [Premium Add-ons](https://stockmanagementlabs.com/addons/ "Our Premium Add-Ons").

= How do I preview and monitor products in the Stock Central screen? =

In Stock Central screen, you can sort your products into two lists, the 'controlled' and 'uncontrolled' list. Products you would like to monitor, control or edit you will see in the default controlled list that shows 'immediately' after you open the Stock Central screen. Products you do not wish to monitor you can find in the 'uncontrolled' list. Move products from one list to another is quick and straightforward and can be done directly on the Stock Central screen.

= Can I quickly change the stock amount for individual products? =

Yes, click the stock amount of the relevant product under the "Current Stock" column. ATUM opens a little pop-up, where you can apply your change. Now you can do many changes at the same time and hit the save button that appears on the top left.

= I have a problem, who do I contact and how? =

Please, in case of a technical issue open an official [support ticket](https://stockmanagementlabs.ticksy.com/) or if it is a simple request, leave a post in the [support forum](https://forum.stockmanagementlabs.com).

= Is the ATUM plugin available in different languages? =

At the time you read this, several translations may be available. To find out more or if you are interested in working with us and translate the plugin, don't hesitate and do it [here](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/atum-stock-manager-for-woocommerce). We will reward you big time!

= Does ATUM Inventory manager for WooCommerce display all product types? =

ATUM support all types of products available in the Free WooCommerce Plugin. We will most likely not support any product types of 3rd parties or premium WooCommerce extensions (apart from the official versions of WooCommerce Subscriptions, WooCommerce Bundles and WooCommerce Bookings).

= Does Stock Central support product variations? =

Product variations are fully supported and editable from Stock Central. ATUM handles variable products with ease and uses an expandable feature to make things clear and straightforward.

= I have updated the ATUM plugin to the last version, and I can't see the new functionality =

If you are using some cache system, try to purge the cache or ask your hosting provider to do it.
Also, try to reload the ATUM pages with CTRL + F5 (Windows) or CMD + R (MacOs) to clear your browser cache.

= The plugin won't work < PHP 5.6 =

We are very sorry, but the current version of the plugin needs PHP 5.6+. Our team has tested it on PHP7 that is recommended by WordPress. Please, see the link [here](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/)

We do not plan any support for older PHP and version 5.6 is the minimum.

= Which third party plugins are officially compatible with ATUM? =

We officially support: WooCommerce Product Bundles, WooCommerce Subscriptions, WooCommerce Bookings and WMPL. Many other plugins can be compatible without any kind of customisation but others can cause conflicts.
